=== Bug importance disclosure terms ===

SEVERITY.
    This term applies to the frequence the particular construct is used
    in the real world. The higher the frequency, the more chances of triggering
    this bug.
	low:	The ASN.1 specifications which could trigger
		this kind of bug are not widespread.
	medium:	The particular ASN.1 construct is used quite often,
		so the chance of triggering an error is considerable.
	high:	This fix is considered urgent, or the particular ASN.1
		construct triggering this bug is in wide use.

SECURITY IMPACT.
    This term applies to the amount of potential damage a bug exploitation
    could cause.
	none:	No malicious exploitation is possible.
	low:	The local exploitation is unlikely; the remote exploitation
		is impossible.
	medium:	The remote exploitation is possible when a particular ASN.1
		construct is being used. If possible, only hard failure, spin
		or memory leak are the possible outcome: no shellcode
		injection could possibly be carried by the attack.
	high:	The remote shellcode injection is possible, or the bug is
		otherwise remotely exploitable for most specifications.
